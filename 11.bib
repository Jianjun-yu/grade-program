Methods. I created a Facebook application that tracked views of {ASD} advocacy or- campaigns, for example, have created subganizations’ posts between July 19, 2011, and December 18, 2012. I evaluated the stantial shifts in public knowledge about lung association between exchanges of emotional language and viral views of posts, controlling for additional characteristics of posts, the organizations that produced them, the social media users who viewed them, and the broader social environment.
Results. Exchanges of emotional language between advocacy organizations and social media users are strongly associated with viral views of posts.
Conclusions. Social media outreach may be more successful if organizations invite emotional dialogue instead of simply conveying information about {ASDs}. Yet exchanges of angry language may contribute to the viral spread of misinformation, such as the rumor that vaccines cause {ASDs}.
